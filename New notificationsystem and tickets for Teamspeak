New Features

A new notificationsystem is implemented.

- if someone joins the Supportchannel's it will trigger an event to post a premade message
- there are 2 diffrent types of messages, one for the community TS and one for the E-Sports TS
- after the support is finished a recation has to be set, to clear the status of support
- if someone joins inadvertently, the message can be deleted or marked with an custom reaktion for it

A new ticketsystem is implemented.

Usecase:
- if someone sends a privatmessage to the bot (scoutship) with the exact command " !ticket (message behind that with an "space")" a ticket is created
- there are 2 diffrent types of messages, one for the community TS and one for the E-Sports TS
- after the support is finished a recation has to be set, to clear the status of support
- if someone creates inadvertently a ticket, the message can be deleted or marked with an custom reaktion for it
